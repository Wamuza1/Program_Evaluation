# Question

**Descriptive**
- What is the average time spent by students?
- Does user registration time and country effect engagement?
- Which browser had the most time spent by students?  

**Predictive**
- Which program will be more prevalent to increase user engagement?
- Will a particular user be more inclined to benefit from binge/drip program than another?
- What is likely to be the best browser to prescribe students? 

# As is & To be State

- As Is State:
Users may have all sorts of other responsibilities and distractions that hinder their engagement to a possibly ill fitting program. User engagement is not optimized. 


- To Be State:
A machine learning model that can accurately relay analytical insight and can still stand true regardless of the data segment used and help stakeholders make decisions that increase user engagement.
